# Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops for IBM Virtual Private Cloud

## Overview

This Terraform module deploys the following VPC infrastructure for enabling CVAD on IBM Cloud:

- VPC
- Subnets
- Public Gateways
- Security Groups
- Active Directory VSIs (Virtual Server Instances)
- Cloud Connector VSIs
- VSI for creating VDA custom image (optional)

![VPC Deployment Model](materials/vpc-deployment.png)

We recommend using the IBM Cloud portal WES-UI to deploy CVAD on IBM Cloud VPC. The WES-UI creates
an IBM Cloud Schematics workspace that points to this Terraform module and deploys your CVAD
infrastructure. Using Schematics is *no additional cost* and provides a way for you to easily manage
your Terraform lifecycle. See
[IBM Cloud portal WES-UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/wes-ui/citrix-virtual-app-desktop).

For more information on IBM Cloud Schematics, see
[IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview).

You may run this Terraform module locally, supplying the necessary variables. See
[Assigning values to root module variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables).

## Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites

#### Upgrading your IBM Cloud Account

To order and use IBM Cloud services, billing information is required for your account. See
[Upgrading Your Account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account).

#### Verify Citrix and Operating System Entitlements

Verify that you have Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops license entitlements. Review the requirements
on
[Citrix Cloud](https://citrix.cloud.com/).

#### Install Terraform

If you wish to run Terraform locally, see
[Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform).

#### IBM Cloud API Key

You must supply an IBM Cloud API key so that Terraform can connect to the IBM Cloud Terraform
provider. See
[Create API Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key).

#### Enable VRF (optional)

If you would like to have network connection between IBM Cloud VPC and Classic Infrastructure, see
[Enabling VRF](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf)
. This option is *not* required to deploy CVAD on IBM Cloud VPC.

#### IBM Cloud Schematics Access Policies

You must create the proper Schematics access policies for a user to deploy CVAD on IBM Cloud VPC
using the
[WES-UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/wes-ui/citrix-virtual-app-desktop?featureFlags=vpcBeta)
or IBM Cloud Schematics. See
[IBM Cloud Schematics Access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access).

## Variable Behavior

There are a number of variables defined in variables.tf used by this Terraform module to
deploy and configure your CVAD infrastructure. This section will describe variable behavior. See
[variables.tf](variables.tf)
for full list of variables with their descriptions, defaults, and conditions.

### Active Directory Topology

#### IBM Cloud

When deploying CVAD on VPC using IBM Cloud topology, the following
infrastructure will be created by default:

- 1 x VPC
- 1 x /24 Subnet (256 IPs)
- 1 x Public Gateway
- 1 x Active Directory VSI
- 2 x Cloud Connector VSIs
- Custom Image VSI (optional)
- 4 Security Groups (5 if Custom Image VSI deployed)
  - Control Plane (Active Directory and Cloud Connector VSIs)
  - VDA VSIs
  - Master Image Prep VSI (VSI deployed during Citrix Machine Catalog creation)
  - Custom Image VSI (optional)

Your Active Directory VSI will run AD install, minimally configured, during post-provisioning. See
[AD Cloudbase-Init section](#active-directory).

Your Cloud Connector VSIs will download and install the Cloud Connector software and IBM Cloud VPC
plugin, and join your AD Domain Controller, during post-provisioning. See
[Cloud Connector Cloudbase-Init section](#cloud-connector).

#### Extended (Multisite)

When deploying using Extended topology, the same infrastructure will be created as IBM Cloud
topology [above](#ibm-cloud) , but the AD and Cloud Connector software will not be installed or
configured on your VSIs. You are required to setup your Active Directory VSI and Cloud Connector
VSIs by running the following scripts located in the respective C:\ drive. See
[AD Extended Cloudbase-Init script section](#active-directory-extended).

### Deploy A Custom Image VSI

You have the option to deploy a VSI to use when creating a custom VDA image for your Citrix Machine
Catalog. Set the `deploy_custom_image_vsi` variable to true if you would like to use this option.
You need to attach a Floating IP to the primary NIC of your Custom Image VSI during post deployment
to enable remote access. A Custom Image VSI security group is created, enabling access to the VSI
using RDP on port 3389.

### Profiles

#### Control Plane VSIs

The `control_plane_profile` variable allows you to specify the VSI profile for your Active Directory
and Cloud Connector VSIs. The default is set to cx2-4x8, but can be overridden with any valid VSI
profile.

#### Custom Image VSI

The `custom_image_vsi_profile` variable allows you to specify the VSI profile for your Custom Image
VSI. The default is set to cx2-4x8, but can be overridden with any valid VSI profile.

See
[VSI profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui).

## Security Groups

As part of your CVAD on VPC deployment, this Terraform module creates the following 4 security
groups:

| Group | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Active Directory | Active Directory VSI |
| Cloud Connector | Cloud Connector VSIs |
| VDA | VDA VSIs that you deploy as part of your Citrix Machine Catalog |
| Master Image Prep | Master Image Prep VSI deployed during Citrix Machine Catalog creation |
| Custom Image (optional) | Custom Image VSI |

Security groups rules are created in accordance with Citrix guidelines. See
[Communication ports used by Citrix](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/build/tech-papers/citrix-communication-ports.html#citrix-cloud).

## Cloudbase-Init Scripts

This Terraform module defines the `userdata` argument on several `resource` blocks in `main.tf`,
providing VSI configuration on initial boot using
[Cloudbase-Init](https://cloudbase.it/cloudbase-init/). See [main.tf](main.tf).

### Active Directory

When using the IBM Cloud topology, this Terraform module will pass the `ad-userdata.ps1` script into
`resource "ibm_is_instance" "active_directory"` along with variables. The `ad-userdata.ps1` script
installs Active Directory, AD Forest, pre-registers Cloud Connectors, and verifies that your AD
Domain Controller is running. Please note, the script registers more Cloud Connectors than deployed
to allow for creating additional Cloud Connectors using this Terraform module. See
[ad-userdata.ps1](scripts/ad-userdata.ps1).

### Active Directory Extended

When using the Extended topology, this Terraform module will pass the `ad-extended.ps1` script into
`resource "ibm_is_instance" "active_directory"` along with variables. The `ad-extended.ps1` script
installs Active Directory, AD Forest, pre-registers Cloud Connectors, and verifies that your AD
Domain Controller is running. Please note that the script registers more Cloud Connectors than
deployed to allow for creating additional Cloud Connectors using this Terraform module. See
[ad-extended.ps1](scripts/ad-extended.ps1).

### Cloud Connector

This Terraform module will pass the `connector-userdata.ps1` script into
`resource "ibm_is_instance" "connector"` along with variables. The `connector-userdata.ps1`script
installs the Cloud Connector
software and registers the Cloud Connector. The script also joins the Cloud Connector to the AD
domain and installs the IBM Cloud VPC Plugin on the Cloud Connector. See
[connector-userdata.ps1](scripts/connector-userdata.ps1).

### Custom Image

This Terraform module will pass the `custom-image-userdata.ps1` script into
`resource "ibm_is_instance" "custom_image_instance"` along with the ad_ip variable. The
`custom-image-userdata.ps1` script sets the DNS on your Custom Image VSI to the IP of your Active
Directory VSI. See
[custom-image-userdata.ps1](scripts/custom-image-userdata.ps1).

## IBM Cloud VPC Plugin

Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops for IBM Cloud uses a plugin architecture to add support for new
hypervisors and cloud providers. Partners and vendors can develop their own plugins which will be
recognized by CVAD. Through a partnership with Citrix, IBM has developed an IBM Cloud VPC plugin
that allows CVAD customers to manage resources on IBM Cloud VPC.

In order to access restricted resources, whether on-prem or in the cloud, CVAD requires the use of
an authorized proxy. This is accomplished with the installation of a Cloud Connector, which
is also used by CVAD plugins that need access to the restricted resources.

This Terraform module downloads the `cvad-plugin.msi` from this repository, then installs and
registers the IBM Cloud VPC Plugin from the msi. See
[Cloud Connector Cloudbase-Init script](#cloud-connector).

## Post Deploy

If you provision a Custom Image VSI, you need to attach a Floating IP to the primary NIC of your
Custom Image VSI during post deployment to enable remote access.

When using the Extended topology, this Terraform module will *not* install Active Directory. You are
responsible for installation and configuration of your multisite Active Directory.

We strongly recommend securing your Active Directory by enabling LDAPS. Follow the Microsoft
guidelines here
[Enabling LDAPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority).

We recommend creating Citrix Machine Catalogs totaling no more than 100 VSIs. When creating
catalogs, you can add multiple NICs to the resulting VSIs. Network Security Groups (NSGs) can be
only be assigned to all NICs. That is, you canâ€™t assign different NSGs to different NICs.

To start creating a Citrix Machine Catalog, login to
[Citrix Web Studio](https://xenapp.cloud.com/manage/webstudio)

## Remote Access and Logging

In order to manage your Active Directory or debug VSIs, you will need to reserve and attach a
Floating IP for each VSI NIC you wish to access. See
[Floating IPs for external connectivity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc#floating-ip-for-external-connectivity).

The Cloudbase-Init scripts described
[above](#cloudbase-init-scripts)
send log messages to `C:\IBMCVADInstallation.log` on each VSI.
The Cloud Connector VSI also contains a log file from the `cvad-plugin.msi` install at `C:\msi.log`.
